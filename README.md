This repository demonstrates a subtle error in VBScript's handling of GetObject and CreateObject.  If CreateObject fails to create an object, it might return an empty object instead of Nothing, leading to difficult-to-debug issues. The example code showcases this behavior and a potential solution.  The solution involves explicit error checking and handling to prevent unexpected behavior.  This is an uncommon error because the lack of explicit error handling from CreateObject is not widely documented.
